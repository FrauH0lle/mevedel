#+title: Todo

* TODO Use new tool preview API
- See ~gptel--tool-preview-alist~

* TODO Mulitple directives: Send them all at once instead individually
- Also make sure that the final diff patch buffer is then stored in ALL
  submitted directives
- Thus, the user can undo from any of them
- However, this would also require to somehow link them to each other as they
  need to change their history together at that point ... Maybe not a good idea?

* TODO [0/1] README
- [ ] Better demo videos

* TODO Reference navigation based on a tag query

* TODO Tag autocompletion when writing directive tag query

* Notes
** Deepseek error:
~DeepSeek error: ((HTTP/2 400) invalid_request_error) Messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceding message with 'tool_calls'~
