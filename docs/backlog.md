# Project backlog

Canonical home for project notes, todos, feature ideas, fixes, and
explicitly deferred work. Read this before planning work in any listed
area.

Use the inbox for ideas that have not been investigated yet. Promote an
item to a detailed entry when its scope and current status are understood.
Remove items when they are implemented, obsolete, or no longer valuable.

## Inbox

- Add a memory-verification slash command or skill that consolidates project
  memories and checks whether they are still accurate; explore whether a
  weekly automated check is useful.
- Rename permission modes: `default` -> `ask`, `accept-edits` -> `edits`, and
  `trust-all` -> `auto`. Thus, UI and internal naming conventions are the same.
  - Or find better names, also fine.
- Pause the "working..." timer while user input is pending.
- Parse shell commands with tree-sitter when available.
- Warnings in Emacs are quite intrusive. Consider making warnings in mevedel target
  the messages buffer ([mevedel] Something happened, can be colored, see corfu) and display the warning also in the view buffer (but not permanent via the data buffer).

## Entry format

Each entry records its source, owed change, reason for deferral, current
status, and blast radius. Keep entries terse and remove them when they
become implemented, obsolete, or unjustified.

## Request lifecycle

### Prevent system sleep during active requests

- **Source:** `mevedel-structs.el` (`mevedel-request-begin`,
  `mevedel-request-push-canceller`); `mevedel-agent-runtime.el`
- **What's owed:** While a top-level or sub-agent request is active, hold an OS
  sleep inhibitor and release it on every completion, failure, abort, and stale
  request replacement path.  On Linux, start `systemd-inhibit --what=sleep` as
  an asynchronous child process and register its teardown as a request
  canceller.  Keep screen blanking and locking unaffected; add other platform
  mechanisms only when they are needed.
- **Why deferred:** Emacs 30 has no portable system-sleep inhibitor, and a
  leaked platform inhibitor could prevent intended suspend indefinitely.
- **Status check:** Request ownership and teardown are already centralized, so
  each request can own its inhibitor without a new session-level reference
  counter.  No inhibitor is currently acquired.
- **Blast radius:** Without this, automatic suspend interrupts long-running
  model, tool, and agent work.  Incorrect cleanup can drain a laptop battery or
  block explicit suspend after mevedel becomes idle.

## Tools

### Bedrock backend support for deferred tool loading

- **Source:** `mevedel-tools.el` (`mevedel-tools--handle-deferred-inject`)
- **What's owed:** Read and replace Bedrock tools under
  `(:toolConfig :tools)` when deferred tools are injected or expired.
- **Why deferred:** Bedrock uses a different payload nesting from the other
  supported gptel backends and has not been exercised here.
- **Status check:** The handler explicitly supports only the common `:tools`
  path.
- **Blast radius:** Bedrock sessions cannot use deferred-tool loading
  correctly.
